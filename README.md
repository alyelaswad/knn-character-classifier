# knn-character-classifier
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for recognizing lower-case characters from noisy image data. The classifier uses an 80%-20% cross-validation approach to determine the optimal value of K, validated over 10 randomized train-validation splits. The final model is evaluated using a separate test dataset.
